Hand-in exercises:

1) Data transformation and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
• The hand-in exercise for this topic is Exercise 3 from the notebook “Exercises in DT and
EDA.ipynb”. The exercise asks you to do an exploratory data analysis of the adult dataset.
There is no change in the exercise and what is required, however, here is an elaboration of
what the exercise involves: 

You need to explain what the data is about, which variables the dataset contains and what their data type is. 
Moreover, for each individual variable you should investigate/explain its distribution/variation through visualization and descriptive statistics. 
Finally, you should investigate/explain the variation/correlation between pairs of
variables – here it is enough to investigate three pairs of variables, one where both
variables are categorical, one where both variables are numeric, and one where one of the
variable is categorical and the other is numeric.

2) Data engineering
• The hand-in exercise for this topic is Task 7 from the notebook “DE_Task.ipynb”. The
exercise asks you to wrap the functionality of other tasks in this notebook into an ETL
pipeline. Note that the GroupBY tasks (which are extra) are not needed in this ETL pipeline.
The data visualization parts are also not needed. The pipeline should contain some of the
data cleaning (such as removing duplicates and nulls) and then creation of features which
are part of task 4 and 5.

3) Statistics
• The hand-in exercise for this topic is Exercise 3 from the notebook “Exercises in
statistics.ipynb”.

4) Regression
• The hand-in exercises for this topic is Exercise 1 and 2 from the notebook “Exercises in
linear regression.ipynb”.

5) Time series
• The hand-in exercise for this topic is Task 3,4 and 6 from the notebook “TSA_Task”. This
means that you have to do the cleaning of dataset, then create features (at least 5 new
features should be created, and you should be able to justify why you created each of the
features). And then, you should train an XGBoost model on the dataset. Note that you also
need to do relevant train, test, validation split and be able to explain why you chose a
certain split. Lastly, you should calculate evaluation metrics: rmse and mae to show
performance of your model. The hyperparameter tuning part is not required.

6) Classification
• The hand-in exercises for this topic is Exercise 2 from the notebook “Exercises in
Classification II.ipynb” (It is the same as Exercise 2 from the notebook “Exercises in
Classification I.ipynb”).

7) IoT and sensor data
• There are two hand-in exercises for this topic:
i. The first one is explained in bullet 2 of slide 16 of the slide deck “IoT & Sensor
Data.pptx”. You need to do the entire task described in bullet 2 of slide 16.
ii. The second one is related to PCA and it is explained in the notebook “pdm_task”.
Note that the data simulation parts are already done for you, so you do not need to
do those parts. You should start from the cell where tasks are listed and you need
to do all 5 tasks.

8) Clustering
• The hand-in exercises for this topic is Exercise 1 from the notebook “Exercises in
Clustering.ipynb”.

9) Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
•

10) Recommender systems
•

11) Neural networks and deep learning
•

12) Generative AI
•

13) Explainability
•

14) Ethical reflections on data science
•
